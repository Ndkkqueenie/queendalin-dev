## About

#### Multi-platform Frontend Developer, Full-stack Developer, IT Support.

Thanks to swift progress of my professional certification and skills specialization, it is glaring
that providing technical insights and guidance are endeavors I would like to engage in even
more. While I was in Junior High School, I developed a keen interest in the building of
computer systems software and technical solutions and I found this very intriguing and
exciting, specifically it's influence in the World today. After my Secondary Education, I pursued
National Diploma in Computer Engineering at Federal Polytecnic Oko but drop-out due to
financial crisis. I became a Computer operator at my LGA and then selt-taught myselt basic
programmimg skills before joining the Andela devC Program in 2018, after that I did my
internship at HNG Tech in 2019 then advance to study a professional specialization in software development using React and React Native 
with Hong Kong University of Science and Technology then IT Support with Google via Coursera.
